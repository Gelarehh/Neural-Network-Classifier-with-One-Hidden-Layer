# Neural Network Classifier for Planner Data
In order to build a Neural Network, we should follow these six steps:

1. Define the number of input units and the number of hidden units
2. Initialize the parameters
3. Implement forward propagation
4. Compute loss
5. Implement backward propagation (to get the gradients)
6. Update parameters (gradient descent)

In this project, planner data in the form of a scatter plot is produced and needs to be classified into two classes. A neural network consisting of one hidden layer is used as the classifier. The Weights matrices are initialized randomly, and bias vectors are initialized to zero values. The non-linear *tanh* function is used as the activation function in the hidden layer.
