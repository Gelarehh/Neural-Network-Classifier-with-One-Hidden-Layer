# Neural-Network-Classifier-with-One-Hidden-Layer

The non-linear *tanh* function in used as the activation function.

In order to build a Neural Network we should:

1. Define the number of input units and the number of hidden units
2. Initialize the parameters
3. Implement forward propagation
4. Compute loss
5. Implement backward propagation (to get the gradients)
6. Update parameters (gradient descent)
