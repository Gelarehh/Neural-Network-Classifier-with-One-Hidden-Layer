# Neural Network Classifier for Planner Data
In order to build a Neural Network, we should follow these six steps:

1. Define the number of input units and the number of hidden units
2. Initialize the parameters
3. Implement forward propagation
4. Compute loss
5. Implement backward propagation (to get the gradients)
6. Update parameters (gradient descent)

Weights matrices are initialized randomly, and bias vectors are initialized to zero values. The non-linear *tanh* function in used as the activation function in the hidden layar.
